Draughts is played on a 64 square checkerboard with eight rows of alternating dark and light coloured squares.

There are two players and each begins the game with 12 draughts, each player having their own colour (black/white).

The players play the game with their draughts always on the dark squares.

The players make one move at a time, moving diagonally in their chosen direction, into an empty square.

If an opponent's piece is in the square diagonally next to a piece, the opponent's piece can be captured by jumping over it.

If there is another piece they can then jump over, they can jump over it.

Players cannot jump over their own pieces.

When a piece reaches the final column of the board, it becomes a king. It will then be able to move forwards and backward, as well as take forwards an backwards.

The game ends when one player loses all of their pieces.
